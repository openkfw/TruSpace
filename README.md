# üåê TruSpace - an ai-infused, decentralized and sovereign document workspace

The purpose of TruSpace is to make collaboration on documents between several stakeholders more efficient while making the respective data sovereign to all participants. It uses AI to support document interpretation and decentralization to stay in control of your data.

**Collaborative, decentralized document sharing and editing platform** built with **Next.js**, **Express.js**, **SQLite**, and **IPFS Cluster**. Enhanced with local LLM capabilities via **Ollama**, **Open Web UI** and a nice web-interface.

## üöÄ Start TruSpace in production

### üîß Prerequisites

- Docker
- File storage for docker volumes

### üì• Quick start

If you want to run in production mode, e.g. on your virtual machine, start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openkfw/TruSpace.git
cd production
bash start-prod.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**  
> If you encounter an error such as  
> `Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/.../truspace/production/volumes/cluster0': chown /.../truspace/production/volumes/cluster0: permission denied`  
> you may need to set the correct permissions for the `/production/volumes` folders using `chown` or `chmod` commands, depending on your system setup.
> You can use commands like `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./volumes` or `sudo chmod -R 744 ./volumes` and restart the application with `bash start-prod.sh`

This script is meant for production run. If you want to start application for local development or testing follow [Dev Installation](./DEV_INSTALLATION.md) manual.

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting local environment started

### üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 22)
- Docker (for IPFS cluster and Ollama models)
- File storage for docker volumes

For installation guide, please see [Installation and running of local environment](./DEV_INSTALLATION.md)

### üì• Quick start

For a very **quick and easy** TruSpace setup (e.g. for demos and first look), run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:openkfw/TruSpace.git
# Start development server
sh start.sh
```

it spins up docker compose containing backend api and IPFS clusters and additionally NextJS frontend in dev mode. After startup, the frontend is available on `http://localhost:3000`. Register a user and start using it!

To enable AI analysis, you need to download the LLM model of your choice, as an example here is `gemma3:1b` and you can see the full list at the [ollama DB](https://ollama.com/library?q=mistral&sort=popular).

- Login to the Open Web UI on `http://localhost:3333`. For login, use the values from the `.env` file, by default `admin@admin.com/admin`. Type the model you specified in the `.env` file in the search bar and Open Web UI offers you to download it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory for development or in `scripts/production` for production usage. Use `.env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This project uses a set of environment variables to configure its frontend, backend, IPFS, and AI components.

For a complete reference and description of all variables, see  
‚û°Ô∏è [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](./ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)

- All inter-node communications are encrypted
- Documents are encrypted with workspace ID

---

## üåê Decentralization with IPFS Cluster

- Each organization runs its own node
- Nodes automatically replicate documents and metadata (e.g. chats, versions, AI perspectives) within the network
- Fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant

## Data model for workspaces in IPFS

The data model has a hierarchical structure of workspaces, documents and metadata. They are linked using UUIDs in the metadata-fields of the IPFS files. Each data entry is a single (small) file to avoid merge conflicts in the IPFS network, e.g. in case of network split. The concept is outlined below:

![Data model](./doc/datamodel.png "Data model")

The specific fields are described in [backend/src/types/interfaces/truspace.ts](backend/src/types/interfaces/truspace.ts)
