# Architecture

In the overview, you can see how the components work together. The UI and API is part of this repository and provides the interface and the translation to other services. Once you start TruSpace, it pulls and connects to containers from Open Web UI (for AI processing) and IPFS/IPFS-Cluster to persist the data. The respective ports are outlined in the image.

### Data model for workspaces in IPFS

The data model has a hierarchical structure of workspaces, documents and metadata. They are linked using UUIDs in the metadata-fields of the IPFS files. Each data entry is a single (small) file to avoid merge conflicts in the IPFS network, e.g. in case of network split. The concept is outlined in the visual representation of the [Data model](./../../doc/datamodel.png "Data model")

The specific fields are described in [backend/src/types/interfaces/truspace.ts](../../backend/src/types/interfaces/truspace.ts)

### ðŸ”„ IPFS Sync for the decentralization of data

- Each organization runs its own node
- Nodes automatically replicate documents and metadata (e.g. chats, versions, AI perspectives) within the network
- Fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant
