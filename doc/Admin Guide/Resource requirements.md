# Resource requirements

To ensure the best possible experience for TruSpace users, we will conduct extensive testing to determine minimal and recommended resource requirements. For now, we can provide some initial estimates based on our development and testing environments.

| Component | Minimum  | Recommended |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| CPU       | 0.5 vCPU | 1 vCPU      |
| RAM       | 1 GB     | 2 GB        |
| Storage   | 1 GB     | 2 GB        |

Please be aware that for environments with multiple parallel users and larger datasets, the resource requirements may increase significantly. We recommend monitoring the performance and adjusting the resources accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> These are initial estimates and may change as we gather more data from testing. We will update this section with more accurate information as we progress in our testing and optimization efforts. If you have specific requirements or use cases, please let us know, and we can provide more tailored recommendations. For now, these estimates should help you get started with TruSpace.
