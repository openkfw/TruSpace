# **Your Place or My Place? — A Tale of Decentralization and Sovereignty**

Once upon a time in a bright, open-plan office with far too many potted plants and a suspiciously artisanal coffee machine, there was Clara Byteworth — the IT admin in charge of document management for her institution.

And boy, did her institution _love_ documents.
They had PDFs, Word files, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoints, scanned faxes from 2004… if it could be saved, it was saved. Twice. In triplicate.

One day, while sipping a lukewarm coffee that tasted suspiciously like regret, Clara read on the internet — and heard from more than a few colleagues — about this thing called **digital sovereignty**.

It seemed to be everywhere: blog posts, industry webinars, and even that chatty guy from procurement who claimed it was “the next GDPR.” Clara, being the guardian of all things document-related, thought she couldn’t ignore it anymore.

## **Scene 1: Liberation from BigTech**

That very week, she decided to ditch the BigTech cloud provider, which she suspected might be under the thumb of the Trump administration by now. It was only a matter of time until a digital tariff or something similar was imposed on her.

Instead, she installed an open-source **document management system**, hosted at her favorite local cloud provider. Now her team had **full control** over their data, their servers, and, most importantly, they felt they could go home without being surprised by some BigTech decision during the night.

Clara felt like a digital freedom fighter, especially because everyone congratulated her on this step — it was something to be posted in internal newsletters and mentioned at tech conferences.

## **Scene 2: The Awkward Question**

One Tuesday afternoon, a business user walked into Clara’s office.

> “We need to share documents with our client. So… should we use **your** platform or **their** platform? And please don't say **email** — we did that in the past, and it’s driving us crazy.”

Clara froze. Sure, her security team was top-notch — the kind of people who used two-factor authentication to unlock the coffee machine — so security wasn’t her concern when opening the system to outsiders. Her concern was **taking responsibility** for every file. Her department would become the document management service provider for the client, and the regulatory team was already knocking at the door.

That sounded like volunteering to host a family reunion… for _someone else’s_ family.

---

## **Scene 3: Meanwhile, at the Client’s Office…**

Over in another IT department, **Greg** — the client’s IT admin — was having the _exact same conversation_.

> **Greg:** “Wait, you want us to use _our_ platform? What if they mess up? Or if their cat walks across the keyboard and deletes everything? No way. Let’s use _their_ system instead.”

In other words:
**Clara didn’t want to be responsible for Greg’s data.**
**Greg didn’t want to be responsible for Clara’s data.**

And thus began the Great Standoff of 2025 — a time full of meetings, packed calendars, and strong opinions.

## **Scene 4: Enter the Nerd**

Just when the situation seemed doomed to descend into an infinite loop of polite refusals, a young intern named **Alex** wheeled his chair over.

> **Alex:** “Why don’t you just use a _decentralized_ solution?”
> **Clara & Greg:** “A what now?”

Alex explained — in the way only a 23-year-old who lives on GitHub badges and open-source enthusiasm can — about **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**.

---

## **Scene 5: The “Aha!” Moment**

> “It’s like this,” Alex said, waving his hands.
> “Instead of uploading your documents to _my_ server or _your_ server, we upload them to a **peer-to-peer network**.
> Everyone gets the same files. Everyone keeps their own copies. A bit like movie sharing on BitTorrent — or, if you’re of a certain age, you might remember Napster.
> Nobody is the single point of failure. Nobody has to ‘trust the other side’… because the system itself is the trust.”

Greg and Clara became curious.

> “So… we can both have the files… without one of us accessing the other’s storage?”
> “Exactly.”
> “And if someone deletes a file?”
> “We use a private network with agreed governance — we can agree that files are deleted on both systems, or we can agree that they’re kept in others. That’s up to you to decide, I don’t care.”

---

## **Scene 6: How the IPFS Private Network Saved the Day**

Clara used her lunch break to read a couple of blogs about IPFS and came back with some concerns.

> “But IPFS is public, right? How do we make sure no random person can peek at our files?”

Alex grinned.

> “We make it private — only our servers access and synchronize the documents.”

### **The Secret Club Key to a Private IPFS Network**

- The “door key” is called a **swarm key**.
- Every node in the private network must have the exact same swarm key — no key, no access.
- Without it, other nodes don’t even _know_ you exist.

---

### **Speaking the Same Gossip Language**

- Files are chopped into chunks, hashed, given unique cryptographic IDs, and replicated on all nodes.
- If Greg adds a file, Clara’s node fetches it automatically in the private swarm — safely and directly.
- Backups and availability are less of a concern. Your server explodes? No problem — rebuild it and reconnect it to the network.

---

### **Everyone Is Responsible for Their Documents**

- There’s no single “master” server — each participant keeps the files they care about.
- If Greg goes offline, Clara still has her copy, and vice versa.
- If more people want to join, let them in and make them part of the network.

---

### **Security by Design**

- A file can never be changed because it is addressed by its fingerprint (hash) in the network. If a new version of the file is uploaded, it is linked to the old version and a new fingerprint is created.
- You can encrypt files before adding them to IPFS so even swarm members only see what they’re meant to see.

---

## **Scene 7: The Happily Ever After (Sort Of)**

Once the private IPFS swarm was running:

- Greg had the files he needed.
- Clara had the files she needed.
- Neither had to open up their document management system to outsiders.
- And no one had to ask:

> **“Your place or my place?”**

Instead, the answer was always:

> **“Our everywhere place.”**

**Moral of the story:**
When in doubt, decentralize.
Because in IT, the only thing scarier than losing control… is being the one responsible when things go wrong.
