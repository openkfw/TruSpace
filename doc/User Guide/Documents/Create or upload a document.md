# Create or upload a document

1. Make sure you are in the workspace where you want to create or upload a document.
2. You can now select whether to create or upload a document:

    <img src="Create_Upload_1.jpg" height=200>

   - **Create** (textual) document:
<img src="Create_2.jpg" height=200>

   - **Upload** document (maximum of 110MB):
<img src="Upload_2.jpg" height=200>

Afterwards, you should see the new document listed in the workspace.
