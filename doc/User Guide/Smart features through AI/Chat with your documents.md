# Chat with your documents

TruSpace has a built-in chat feature which allows users to interact with their documents in a conversational manner through the use of LLMs. Similar to other chatbots, users can ask questions about the content of their documents and receive answers based on the information contained within them. This feature is particularly useful for quickly retrieving information, clarifying doubts, or exploring specific aspects of a document without having to read through the entire text.

The feature is based on [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) and supports various (local) LLMs.
