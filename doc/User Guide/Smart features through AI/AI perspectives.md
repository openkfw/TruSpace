# AI perspectives

To get unique perspectives on documents, TruSpace leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to generate AI perspectives. These perspectives are designed to provide insights from various angles, such as financial, legal, or technical viewpoints.

Users can select from a range of predefined perspectives or create custom ones tailored to their specific needs. The AI-generated perspectives are intended to enhance understanding and facilitate informed decision-making.

Further, users can also create their own perspectives to share insights based on their expertise (see more [here](../Documents/Collaborate%20on%20documents.md)).
