# Public vs. private workspaces

TruSpace gives the user the ability to create public or private workspaces.

**Public** workspaces are available to all users in TruSpace. The users can create and delete documents and collaborate together.

**Private** workspaces are only available to registered participants. After creation, only the creator has access to the workspace. Other users can be added as participants. The participants then have the same rights and can interact with the documents in the workspace.

For environments requiring limited access and safety due to e.g. highly sensitive documents, it makes sense to create private workspaces. For use cases involving many participants and not requiring limited access, perhaps also in a testing phase, it can make sense to create public workspaces. It is **crucial** to be aware of the requirements and to make an informed decision on creating a public or private workspace.
