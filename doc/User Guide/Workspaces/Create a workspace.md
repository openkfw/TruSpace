# Create a workspace

1. You can create a new workspace by adding it in the sidebar on the left:

    <img src="Create_1.jpg" height=200>

2. Afterwards, a dialog will be opened where you can<br>
   - name the workspace
   - set it as private (read more [here](Public%20vs%20private%20workspaces.md))

    <img src="Create_2.jpg" height=200>

3. After adding the workspace, you should now be able to see and access it in the sidebar:

    <img src="Create_3.jpg" height=300>

You have now successfully created a new workspace!
