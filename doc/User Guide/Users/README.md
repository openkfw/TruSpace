# Users

To access TruSpace, you need to create a user account. Each user has a unique username and password. With the authorization token, users can access their private workspaces as well as public workspaces. Different users can have different access rights to the same workspace, allowing for flexible collaboration.

Here are some more instructions and guidances on how to use users in TruSpace:

- [Login / Register & Logout](Login%20register%20logout%20user.md)
