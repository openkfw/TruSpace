# Use cases

Below are several use cases that highlight why the application around IPFS should be actively adopted:

## Global Development Projects with Challenging Infrastructure

_Access to knowledge and data must not fail due to a lack of internet infrastructure._<br>
Many partner countries suffer from unreliable network connections.
With IPFS, content can be cached locally while remaining globally accessible – even when the central source is unreachable.
Development project materials (e.g., textbooks, technical documentation, training videos) can be made resilient and accessible in the long term.

## Censorship-Resistant Information Distribution

_Freedom of information is a cornerstone of sustainable development._<br>
In politically unstable regions, relying on centralized servers can be risky.
IPFS ensures that important content (e.g., awareness materials, health information, transparency reports) cannot be deleted or blocked.
This is especially relevant for projects supporting democracy, good governance, or human rights.

## Transparent & Immutable Project Archiving

_Trust through transparency and immutability._<br>
IPFS enables the immutable archiving of project documents, contracts, images, and interim reports.
The use of content hashes protects against subsequent tampering.
Ideal for audits, public accountability, and long-term traceability of project progress.

## Cost-Efficient and Sustainable IT Infrastructure

_Not everyone needs a server – but everyone can be part of the internet._<br>
Reduced reliance on expensive, centralized cloud services.
IPFS can run on low-cost hardware – even on a Raspberry Pi.
With “pinning-as-a-service” offerings, content can be made available long-term at low cost.
