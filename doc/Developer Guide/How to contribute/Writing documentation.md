# Writing documentation

## Why?

TruSpace stores all relevant documentation in the `doc` folder. This ensures that all information is centralized and easily accessible for developers, contributors, admins and users. It is crucial that the documentation remains up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the project. Therefore, if you detect any discrepancies or outdated information, please take the time to update it or create an issue to discuss the necessary changes.

## Syntax

When writing documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use Markdown syntax for formatting.
2. Keep your language clear and concise.
3. Use code blocks for any code snippets.
4. Include examples where applicable.
