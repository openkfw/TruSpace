# GitHub Issues, Pull Requests and Discussions

## Issues

If you noticed a bug or want to suggest a new feature, feel free to create a [new issue](https://github.com/openkfw/TruSpace/issues). We have created a few templates to help you get started for:

- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Documentation Improvement

Please choose the appropriate template when creating a new issue, otherwise a blank issue.

## Pull Requests

When working on a change in the repository, you can open a [new pull request](https://github.com/openkfw/TruSpace/pulls) as soon as you push the first changes in the branch. We have also created a template to assure a smooth review process. Please fill out the template with as much detail as possible to help the reviewers understand your changes. If applicable, mention what issue will be closed with this pull request, by filling out `Closes #issueNumber`.

## Discussions

If you have questions or want to discuss a specific topic, you can create a new discussion in the [Discussions](https://github.com/openkfw/TruSpace/discussions) section. This is a great place to engage with the community, share ideas, and get feedback on your thoughts. You can also add tags to your discussion to help categorize it and make it easier for others to find.
